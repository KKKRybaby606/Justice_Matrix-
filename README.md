Verification Guide

Step 1: Verify IPFS Content

1. Access IPFS files using a public gateway:

https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>


2. Confirm the file contents match the originals in this package.


3. Cross-check CIDs with entries in blockchain_anchors.csv for integrity.




---

Step 2: Verify Blockchain Anchors

1. Use an Ethereum or Polygon blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan, PolygonScan).


2. Search for the provided transaction hashes listed in blockchain_anchors.csv.


3. Confirm the on-chain transactions contain or reference the respective IPFS CIDs.


4. Confirm timestamps correspond to the documented minting dates.




---

Step 3: NFT Provenance & Metadata

1. Access NFT metadata files (e.g., JM_Anthem_0311.json) through IPFS.


2. Confirm the NFT token IDs match those minted on the blockchain.


3. Check that token ownership and royalty information correspond to DAO treasury addresses and governance settings.




---

Step 4: Smart Contract Auditing

1. Review the JusticeMatrixOralChain.sol Solidity code for:

Hearing initiation and quorum enforcement.

Speaker turn management.

Event logging for transparency.

Dispute raising protocols.



2. Verify contract deployment and events on the blockchain testnet or mainnet.


3. Confirm the contract address and related event logs are included in the DAO governance submissions.




---

Step 5: DAO Submission & Governance

1. Review the DAO_Submission_Template.md for governance process details.


2. Confirm voting periods, quorum rules, and approval thresholds.


3. Track DAO votes and final approvals on-chain.


4. Confirm royalty distribution setup to the Justice Forward Fund treasury wallet.
